### Progress report
My previous experience with both Git versioning control and GitHub (and it's desktop client) was helpful for getting started. I still have more work to do with the Data Structures portion of the assignment â€” something a fresher will help with.

### Feedback
The instructions for this assignment required more thinking than the first assignment.
