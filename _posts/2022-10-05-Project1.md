#### Progress report
Project 1 at first glance seemed daunting (with all the req. and all), but once we got together for our first meeting
it's all become much "easier." Our team chose our leader and with her guidance we've confidently gone through each task 
without any difficulties. Final note: I'm really proud of our group's communication skills.
