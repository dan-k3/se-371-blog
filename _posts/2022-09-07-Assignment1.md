### Progress report
Second week and I've gotta say I'm really excited to be in this class! For our first assignment, we're tasked with setting with setting up our dev environment â€” thankfully, I already had a working environment that met the required criteria. For my IDE I'll be using VS Code. For the Personal Blog I hope to use GitHub pages. And speaking of GitHub, I already have some experience with Git, even if it's mostly through GitHub's desktop client.

### Feedback
I really enjoyed this intro assignment as it's helped me think about aspects I hadn't considered.
